# Introduction-to-Scientific-Programming
### Overview of the course
Recent advancements in information-gathering technologies have resulted in the production of high volume, diverse and versatile spatial data. Satellite imagery, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), GPS-enabled handheld devices and Location-based Social Networks are generating various spatial and spatiotemporal data on a daily basis. Such a diversity of data has opened a new window toward tackling a wide range of significant problems that had been out of reach a decade ago.
Working with those complex data sources requires scientists to get armed with new skills and dexterities. Scientific programming is one of the required skills that allows us to access different data sources, manipulate the underlying data, and freely apply different sorts of analysis on our data. This course is an introductory course in which you will learn basic scientific programming concepts in Python, focusing on spatial data analytics.

### Learning Objectives
Completion requirements
At the end of this course, the students should:

1.	Understand the syntax of Python programming language and data structures.
2.	Learn how to better design, develop and implement solutions with Python programming.
3.	Equip you with knowledge required to write programs that perform automated task.
4.	Be able to read and manipulate data from files
5.	Equip to the background knowledge about theory of computer programming, pragmatics, and literate programming.
6.	Be able to work with scientific libraries for mathematical analysis and generating charts. 
7.	Be able to manipulate vector and raster data in Python and develop simple processing procedures.
8.	Be able to choose and apply a proper approach to integrate raster and vector data.
9.	Work independently in developing python script to solve scientific problems by integrating knowledge on the topics covered in the course

This course covers a wide range of topics offered through reading material, recorded video lectures, discussions, tutorials, and practical exercises. It covers principles of python scripting, algorithmics, scientific libraries, and geoprocessing. The course is useful for both the novice to scientific programming and the one experienced in python programming but missing the knowledge of scientific libraries or geoprocessing functionalities.

### How to follow course
Completion requirements
This course covers a wide range of topics offered through reading material, recorded video lectures, discussions, tutorials, and practical exercises. Topics are organized into pages. Inside each page, you will find:

* Links to the recorded video lectures.
* Links to the presentation files and other reading materials.
* Practical exercises for each topic and data resources.
* Answers to each exercise will be published 3-days after the presentations.
* Please start by watching the video lectures. At the same time, you can use the presentation files and also other materials that are provided to increase your knowledge about the subject. After that, you should work on the related exercise. Try to implement everything on your machine. Use the forums to get help from other students and share what you learn with them. Check your outputs with the answers that are published for each exercise after 3 days.
* Use the discussion forum to post any questions or feedback. Peer-to-peer discussion is highly encouraged.

3. Algorithmics
* Programming doesn't only involve writing codes. There are other activities that come before you take your computer to start writing codes. First, there should be a problem in which programming can offer a desirable solution, quicker and precisely. Note that not all problems are solved by programming. Once you have a problem, you must think over its solution which entails a step-by-step process that should be followed. This will require an algorithm and workflow development.

This lecture is meant to bring you to speed with the principles of writing good codes, testing, and documenting them.
